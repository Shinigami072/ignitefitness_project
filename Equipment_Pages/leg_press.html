        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm up for at least 5 minutes by stretching beforehand</li>
            <li>Start at a small weight you are comfortable with and work your way up to heavier weights</li>
            <li>Use the yellow release lever to adjust the platform to be a comfortable position when your knees are
                bent. Make sure the lever locks into place after any adjustment you make</li>
        </ol>

        <h3> Recommended Usage:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Sit on the seat, making sure your back is pressed against the support of the seat and you are gripping
                the handles firmly</li>
            <li>Place your feet on the platform, hip-width apart. Extend your legs without locking your knees</li>
            <li>Inhale as you straighten your legs to push the platform forward, until your knees are completely flexed
            </li>
            <li>Slowly flex your knees in the opposite direction to return to the starting position, exhaling as you do
                so</li>
